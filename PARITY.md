# MATLAB WEC-Sim comparison

This fork started from THREDgroup/WEC-Sim-Python `c04ef427` (October 2021).
The current MATLAB reference reviewed for this baseline is
[WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim `0753b2e47f2457c078751dcfe5d251d1767b80ab`](https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim/tree/0753b2e47f2457c078751dcfe5d251d1767b80ab).
The original Python repository includes MATLAB-generated fixtures, but there
is no MATLAB or Octave executable on the local machine. The `MATLAB reference
parity` GitHub Actions workflow checks out the pinned MATLAB revision, runs
its `waveClass` under MATLAB R2025b, and compares the generated outputs with
the production Python code. The live wave comparison passed on 6 October
2026. The workflow saves the MATLAB outputs as an artifact.

| Behavior | Reference | Baseline result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Regular-wave elevation, ramp, and three gauge positions | Original MATLAB-generated `regular_1_test` files | Production `WaveClass` agrees within `1e-12` absolute error. |
| Finite-depth wave number | Current MATLAB `calcWaveNumber.m` dispersion relation | Python residual is checked to relative tolerance `1e-13`. |
| Finite-depth regular-wave power | Current MATLAB `waveClass.m` group-velocity equation | Corrected denominator to `sinh(2kh)`; tested at 25 m depth. |
| Irregular Bretschneider equal-energy binning | Original MATLAB-era test constants | Production `WaveClass` agrees after NumPy/SciPy API updates. This is historical compatibility only: current MATLAB WEC-Sim rejects the `BS` option. |
| Wave-surface grid for no-wave, regular, and directional irregular waves | Current MATLAB `waveClass.waveElevationGrid` equations | Implemented and checked for regular and two-direction irregular cases. |
| RM3 HDF5 hydrodynamic input | Original `rm3.h5` | Both bodies load, including their names and water depth, under NumPy 2. |
| Current RM3 and OSWEC HDF5 hydrodynamic inputs | Pinned current MATLAB core examples | Both bodies in each model load and complete regularCIC or directional irregular preprocessing with finite restoring, added-mass, excitation, and radiation arrays. This is input compatibility, not motion parity. |
| RM3 regular-wave force preprocessing | Original MATLAB-generated `body_1_test` constants and files | Production `BodyClass` agrees for restoring stiffness, added mass, excitation, and radiation IRF; the RM3 runner now completes preprocessing. |
| RM3 irregular-wave force preprocessing | Original MATLAB-generated `body_2_test` files | Production `BodyClass` agrees for restoring stiffness, added mass, excitation, and radiation IRF. |
| RM3 body interaction force preprocessing | Original MATLAB-generated `body_4_test` through `body_9_test` files | All six regular/regularCIC variants, including body-to-body coupling on/off and state-space radiation on/off, agree for both RM3 bodies on restoring stiffness, added mass, excitation, radiation IRF, and state-space matrices where present. |
| OSWEC directional irregular force preprocessing | Original MATLAB-generated `body_3_test` files | Production `BodyClass` agrees for restoring stiffness, added mass, radiation IRF, and three-direction excitation after replacing removed SciPy `interp2d`. |
| Sphere `noWaveCIC` heave free decay (0 m, 1 m, 1 m with Morison elements, 3 m, 5 m) | Current MATLAB WEC-Sim and MATLAB-generated Sphere HDF5 | The focused Python linear heave solver agrees over 40 s to maximum differences of 0.45 mm position, 0.64 mm/s velocity, and 363 N total force in the 5 m case. The Morison element has only x-direction coefficients in the published 1 m case, so it does not affect heave. |
| RM3 regular-wave heave, excitation, and PTO | Current MATLAB RM3 example and current RM3 HDF5 | A focused two-body linear heave solver with relative-motion PTO damping agrees locally over 400 s within 5.9 mm position and 6.1 mm/s velocity for both bodies. Heave excitation matches to less than `1e-5` N; PTO internal force differs by at most 8.2 kN over a 1.63 MN range. This reduced model does not cover surge, pitch, or full Simscape joint mechanics. |
| RM3 coupled surge, heave, pitch, and PTO | Current MATLAB RM3 example and current RM3 HDF5 | A four-coordinate two-body model uses the published joint geometry, body inertias, regular-wave forcing, and nonlinear rotation kinematics. Over 400 s, the two body surge positions differ by at most 36.3 mm, heaves by 4.2 mm, shared pitch by 0.00086 rad, and PTO force by 4.7 kN. It covers the canonical active DOFs but not general Simscape joint mechanics or other RM3 cases. |
| OSWEC PM equal-energy waves, directional excitation, pitch, and PTO | Current MATLAB OSWEC example and current OSWEC HDF5 | Python recreates all 500 PM equal-energy bins from the HDF5 range, then synthesizes wave elevation and six-component excitation using the saved MATLAB phase matrix. Local component differences are below `6e-15`, elevation below `2e-13` m, and excitation below `1e-7` N. The fixed-hinge solver's pitch differs by at most 0.0021 rad over 400 s; PTO torque from the paired-force check differs by at most 37 N m. A Python seed produces a separate reproducible realization. This model covers pitch about a fixed hinge, not a general six-DOF device. |
| General WEC-Sim runner | Current MATLAB RM3 and OSWEC examples | **Not yet available.** The inherited runner has no dynamics solver; its simulation stage is commented out. The focused reference-model solvers above are separate modules. |

## Reference model and case inventory

`tests/reference_cases.csv` inventories 63 published input files at the
pinned revisions: two core examples and 61 WEC-Sim Applications cases. It
identifies 21 RM3, 13 OSWEC, and 12 Sphere cases by explicit hydrodynamic
file paths, plus 17 other or dynamic cases. Generate the CSV with
`python tools/build_reference_case_inventory.py CORE_CHECKOUT APPLICATIONS_CHECKOUT`.
This is a source inventory, not a claim that every case runs in Python.

The `MATLAB reference model baselines` workflow runs the two canonical core
examples and all five Sphere free-decay cases from the Applications suite.
It records time, position, velocity, total force, and excitation force for
each body as CSV artifacts. New runs also record position, velocity, internal
mechanics force, and power for each PTO. The Applications source is pinned to
[`d53d4d4c9eda2581f04204f5d394a6ef84bb099e`](https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim_Applications/tree/d53d4d4c9eda2581f04204f5d394a6ef84bb099e).
The first run [passed all three model jobs](https://github.com/cmudrc/WEC-Sim-Python/actions/runs/37471757955),
producing nine finite body trajectories with 4,001 samples each (two RM3,
two OSWEC, and five Sphere). The `1m-ME` and `1m` Sphere trajectories were
identical in the saved motion and force signals: the Morison element in that
published case has nonzero coefficients only in x while the free-decay motion
is in heave.
The renewed [model baseline run](https://github.com/cmudrc/WEC-Sim-Python/actions/runs/37472556464)
also generated the Sphere HDF5 file with current MATLAB BEMIO and verified
Python preprocessing of it. `source/objects/linearHeave.py` uses that
preprocessing, the heave restoring coefficient, infinite-frequency added
mass, and radiation impulse-response kernel. It integrates the resulting
linear convolution equation with a fixed 0.01 s trapezoidal step. The five
Sphere trajectory comparisons [passed in the same MATLAB job](https://github.com/cmudrc/WEC-Sim-Python/actions/runs/37476318082)
so that the source, HDF5, time grid, and output remain paired.
The [current reference-model run](https://github.com/cmudrc/WEC-Sim-Python/actions/runs/37483219008)
passed all RM3, OSWEC, and Sphere jobs, including Python preprocessing of
the current RM3 and OSWEC HDF5 inputs for both bodies and the focused dynamics
comparisons described above.
The RM3 baseline also checks a reduced Python heave model and a coupled
surge/heave/pitch model. The OSWEC baseline
saves its random phase matrix and checks Python PM binning, wave elevation,
directional excitation, and hinged-pitch motion against that same realization.
The Python wave generator can use its own integer seed for standalone runs,
but its random sequence differs from MATLAB's Threefry generator. The runner
still has no general dynamics solver.
For the supported canonical cases, `python -m source.objects.referenceRunner`
provides a standalone RM3, OSWEC, or Sphere command. It writes a CSV and a
JSON reproducibility record containing settings, the HDF5 SHA-256 hash, the
NumPy version, and Git revision/dirty state. It does not execute arbitrary
WEC-Sim input files.
Expanded application cases remain inventoried. The manually dispatched
`MATLAB reference application regression`
workflow can run the upstream test suites for all 18 application folders
containing the 46 explicit RM3, OSWEC, and Sphere cases. This checks the
pinned MATLAB reference for those cases, but there is no Python time-series
comparison yet.

The [first full application sweep](https://github.com/cmudrc/WEC-Sim-Python/actions/runs/37472556454)
recorded 42 passed methods, two failed Passive Yaw assertions, two MoorDyn
methods filtered by upstream's CI assumption, and an empty Multiple Wave
Spectra suite. Both Variable Hydro methods passed under MATLAB R2025b. A
targeted direct run subsequently passed Multiple Wave Spectra, bringing
the exercised passing checks to 43.

The first application sweep revealed upstream test-suite limitations. In
`Passive_Yaw`, two stored irregular-yaw regression checks fail; the same two
checks fail in [the Applications repository's own CI run](https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim_Applications/actions/runs/36746373598)
on both Linux and Windows under MATLAB R2024b. MoorDyn tests in `Mooring` and
`Paraview_Visualization` explicitly skip themselves on GitHub CI. Forcing the
MoorDyn test exposed a native library mismatch (`GLIBCXX_3.4.32` unavailable
from MATLAB's bundled `libstdc++`), so those cases remain unverified in CI.
The `Multiple_Wave_Spectra` test class is excluded by MATLAB because its
class name does not match its filename. Our harness generates its OSWEC HDF5
file with BEMIO, runs the input file directly, and requires body output
instead of accepting an empty test suite as success. The
[direct case passed](https://github.com/cmudrc/WEC-Sim-Python/actions/runs/37476616198).
The Passive Yaw and MoorDyn findings are MATLAB-reference gaps, not evidence
of Python dynamics agreement or disagreement.

## Known differences and next reference case

Current MATLAB WEC-Sim has changed its PM/JS spectra, seeded phase generator,
object properties, and some wave inputs since the Python port was written.
The historical fixtures therefore cannot establish parity for those modes.
The focused OSWEC PM implementation above is checked against current MATLAB;
the inherited general `WaveClass` still needs corresponding updates for other
irregular-wave cases.
The next dynamics targets are additional RM3 and OSWEC application variants,
other OSWEC force terms, and integration into a general runner. The Sphere free-decay
cases already have direct Python motion comparisons. A comparison must
record both code revisions, the HDF5 input, time step, outputs, and numerical
tolerances.

The inherited `paraviewClass.py` was invalid Python mixed with unfinished
MATLAB code. The wave-surface calculation is now importable; VTP serialization
and body visualization explicitly raise `NotImplementedError` until ported.
The older object tests import duplicate copies of classes inside test folders.
The parity tests here import the production files instead.
